Okay, so you want a sexy page turn like @elliottkember?

This is your chance.

Please note, before you install this, you'll need a few things from jQuery UI.
jQueryUI 1.5.3 seems to work, but 1.6 doesn't.
If you're using a custom download, you'll need to add Resizable.

Copy everything in this repository into the /turn/ folder in your public directory.

Now, in your HTML, insert an object like this:

	<img id="target" src="turn/code.png">
						 â†‘
Take note, it has an ID. This is useful. The object does not have to be an image, but images look awesome.
For instance, I use a screenshot of my site's HTML code.

If you don't have jQuery and jQueryUI, use these lines as needed in your HTML <head>

	<script type="text/javascript" src="turn/jquery1.3min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="turn/jqueryui.js"></script>

Then, still in your HTML <head>, put:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="turn/turn.js"></script>

	<script type="text/javascript" src="turn/turn.js"></script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="turn/turn.css">

	<script type="text/javascript">
		$(document).ready(function(){
			$( '#target' ).fold();
		});
	</script>

And your site should be awesome too.

Now, if you're a clever clogs and look at the code, you'll find this:

	// Default awesomeness
	var defaults = {
		directory: 'turn',			// The directory we're in
	  side: 'left',           // change me to "right" if you want rightness
		turnImage: 'fold.png',  // The triangle-shaped fold image
	  maxHeight: 400,					// The maximum height. Duh.
		startingWidth: 80,			// The height and width 
		startingHeight: 80			// with which	to start
	};
	
These are the default values, and you can specify them as you see fit in your HTML.
For instance, if you went like this:

	$(document).ready(function(){
		$( '#target' ).fold({
			side: 'right'								// Right! Whoa!
		});
	});

You'd get the page turning from the top-right... and that'd be awesome.
